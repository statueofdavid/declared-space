			<p>My backyard is starting to bloom and although Spring is often overrated in my mind, there are moments when it is not. For me its magic and beauty can happen from 11am until 2pm. Oddly specific I know but I am an oddly specific kind of human. Summer has the evening and night times. Fall has the morning hours, but winter has my heart. It is the only chill time of the season, post holiday of course.</p>
		<h4>Interviewing</h4>
			<p>Not much else than that really. There is always a line about what someone should and shouldn't say about a public entity. I find that when ever I am bullish, I tend to ignore and bottle it up until I have painted myself into a corner. When I am bearish, I tend to paralyze myself and burn up like Icarus. Anytime I just relax, start slow, and intentionally go with what I know, I end up getting more done correctly then I or anyone else expected.</p>
		<h4>Website and My Side Game</h4>
		<p>Well not much has changed on the surface but I have been working on it. <a ahref="about.html">Go here and follow the link to my GitHub repos </a> I have not yet put BCubed code base into a version control system like github. This site is my biggest priority because to me it unlocks all the other things swirling in my brains. <a href="index.html">As always, go here and check out my site.</a> I have been a bit silent on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/dmill/">LinkedIn</a> lately but I am posting a few times a week on <a href="https://twitter.com/StatueOfDavid">Twitter</a> if you need dose of oddly specific human thought.</p>
		<p>My family is ok. I am ok. My friends are ok.</p>
