                <h3>Times a-Changin' - April 7th, 2024</h3>
			<p>Hi. I am not sure how to start, ANYTHING. I am not even sure why I make the first step such an orchestration when, upon reflection, whatever <i>it</i> happens to be is hardly ever as what I had played a thousand times in my pea head. If we are judging by now, you know who are, it could be concluded that by now I have had many opportunities to learn this behavior as a skill to use as needed, but I have not but I can say, with confidence, that I am aware. As a 40-something white married male human, I am at least aware... of this... as a skill I should work toward attaining. I am not the most aware person sometimes, but I want to be. I often dream of being someone or something I am not.</p>
			<p>Now that the meandering ramble of an introduction to the latest blog entry continues to uncork, I think I should switch topics and take care of some announcements, or whatever the part is called in the blog where the author mentions what is happening in their lives, as in making mention of events in their life that the author feels is important enough to mention. So before I enter yet another meandering verbal trance, spewing as much vague non-sense as possible, here is a run-down of what has happened in the last 8-ish months.</p>
		<h4>Leadership at SVT Decided to Move On</h4>
			<p>I am grateful for the experiences while working at SVT. I am thankful for the humans I met there. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dmill_softwareengineering-opentowork-activity-7138226023250198528-IyMI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">I shared this moment on LinkedIn</a>Full Transparency: I cracked after the first round of layoffs. I let my emotions affect my work. It happens and another thing I am very aware of now that I must put my attention toward so I can be better.</p>
		<h4>I Started The BCubed Project</h4>
			<p>Out of that I made progress on building my first "product". More to come. I may update with links here and here after I get the delivery infrastructure up and up... lots to do. Most importantly here I believe that this project really really helped me find some direction and reignite my passion to learning my craft. Ugh but if only I could perfect the art of time management.</p>
		<h4>It is Rare for a Good Thing to Last</h4>
		<p>In January I started a new job doing system integrations and Android application development for a hip Engineering Firm named Aries Defense and in March they let me go.<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dmill_opentowork-newopportunities-software-activity-7171606066743365632-sxrm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop">Not Much Has Changed.</a> I am hopeful. It is giving me more opportunities to make memories with friends and family but also continue to ignite my passion for digital technologies.</p>
		<h4>What's Next</h4>
		<p>More updates to <a href="index.html">this site.</a> Updates to BCubed. Gardening and entering new pastures for my family and I to graze on. All in the pursuit to being a real boy. My family is ok. I am ok. Friends are ok.</p>
		<p>I am going to re-attempt a blogging goal: Once a week. Release on Monday.</p>
