                <h3>Times a-Changin' - April 7th, 2024</h3>
                <p>today I learned a bit more about expectation management, kindsa like I am with this blog. the goal is simple. compose a blog entry every day for the next year. tbh... not convinced I will succeed, but that is part of it. I need intent. I need meaning. I want to make it. This is me doing what I can to make it. Fran and I are kindsa sortofs getting half serious bout the pod... and maybe about pigeon hold. the new journey is way underway. I hope I can maintain this energy this time... just hold this thread and watch me walk away. </p>
                <p>I am not really sure what else to write. life is ok. I am ok. Most humans I know are doing ok.</p>
