			Hi. I am not sure how to start, ANYTHING. I am not even sure why I make the first step such an orchestration when, upon reflection, whatever <i>it</i> happens to be is hardly ever as what I had played a thousand times in my pea head. If we are judging by now, you know who are, it could be concluded that by now I have had many opportunities to learn this behavior as a skill to use as needed, but I have not but I can say, with confidence, that I am aware. As a 40-something white married male human, I am at least aware... of this... as a skill I should work toward attaining. I am not the most aware person sometimes, but I want to be. I often dream of being someone or something I am not.

			Now that the meandering ramble of an introduction to the latest blog entry, I think I should take care of announcements, or whatever the part is called in the blog where the author mentions what is happening in their lives, as in making mention of events in their life that the author's is important enough to mention. So before I enter yet another meandering verbal trance, spewing as much vague non-sense possible, here is a run-down of what has happened in the last 8-ish months.

		<h4>Leadership at SVT Decided to Move On</h4>
		<p>Full Transparency: It is only now that I am beginning to process all that went down during my tenure at SVT. I will start with the beginning I think. I had been fantasized about working at SVT since Mike and AK started it. That fantasization made UZURV less appealing and I began to perservate on the fact there was another resource at UZURV with the same job title as bestowed on me by UZURV leadership. There are parts of me that thinks I should have stayed at UZURV. Those same parts believe I could have done better. The rest of me believes I made the right decision because I gained so much viable experience. I hope one day I can find peace with this event.
