                <h3>Times a-Changin' - April 7th, 2024</h3>
			<p>Hi. I am not the most aware person sometimes, but I want to be. I often dream of being someone or something I am not. </p>
			<p> Here is a run-down of what has happened in the last 8-ish months.</p>
		<h4>Leadership at SVT Decided to Move On</h4>
			<p>I am grateful for the experiences at SVT. I am thankful for the humans I met there. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dmill_softwareengineering-opentowork-activity-7138226023250198528-IyMI?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop"> I shared this moment on LinkedIn </a></p>
		<h4>I Started The BCubed Project</h4>
		<p>More to come. I may update with links here and here after I get the delivery infrastructure up and up </p>
		<p> ... lots to do ... </p>
		<p> Ugh but if only I could perfect the art of time management.</p>
		<h4>It is Rare for a Good Thing to Last</h4>
		<p> In January I started a new job for a hip Engineering Firm and in March they let me go. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/dmill_opentowork-newopportunities-software-activity-7171606066743365632-sxrm?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_desktop"> Not Much Has Changed. </a> </p>
		<h4>What's Next</h4>
		<p>More updates to <a href="index.html">this site.</a> Updates to BCubed. Gardening and entering new pastures for my family and I to graze on. All in the pursuit to being a real boy. My family is ok. I am ok. Friends are ok.</p>
		<p>I am going to re-attempt a blogging goal: Once a week. Release on Monday.</p>
